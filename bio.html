				About Me
			</h2>
			<span id="font">
				I was born in Lagos, Nigeria 21 years ago. Moved to the United States when I was 8.
				Went to military school for three years and graduated from The Scholars' Academy (High School) in
				June 2016. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Tufts
				University. Expected to graduate May 2020.

					Hobbies
				</h2>
				<span id="font">
					I have a deep passion for Dance. On my free time, that is what I love to do. I am a somewhat 
					good cook and love experimenting with code on the side. I also love to take a few hours to 
					myself each week to wind down and watch Netflix. When I can, I love to be involved with 
					activities that involve the Arts in some way shape or form.
