1.  Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
I correctly implemented all the my website using the guidelines listing on the page. The re-direct link works and the images included were uploaded from my Desktop and not with a URL. I also used the validator.w3.org website to help validate and confirm that everything was implemented correctly and the results proved exactly that.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
I met with TA Michael Robinson a lot for help and ask Ming for help when needed. Other than that, I consulted Google/StackOverFlow/Cheat Sheets on course websites

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
I spent about 7 hours on this assignment (2 of which was spent trying to figure out how to really understand and use Git through the terminal).
