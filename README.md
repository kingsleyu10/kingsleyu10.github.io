1. I correctly implemented all the my website using the guidelines listing on the page. The re-direct link works and the images included were uploaded from my Desktop and not with a URL. I also used the validator.w3.org website to help validate and confirm that everything was implemented correctly and the results proved exactly that.

2. I met with TA Michael Robinson a lot (during his OH) and asked Ming for help when needed. Other than that, I consulted Google/StackOverFlow/Cheat Sheets on the course website.

3. I spent about 7 hours on this assignment (2 of which was spent trying to figure out how to really understand and use Git through the terminal).
